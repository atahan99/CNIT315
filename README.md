This course introduces concepts of lower level systems programming in C/C++ on a UNIX/Linus operation system platform. Command level development, algorithms, data structures, iteration and recursion, algorithms and analysis.

Lab 1 Description: 

- Pool and hot tube volume calculation. And calculating
how much would it cost to fill it with water.

Lab 2 Description: 
- This program will help a robot to find a path in a maze using recursive methods and display all the progress of the robot in the maze. Lastly it will show the correct path found. 

Lab 3 Description: 
- This is an linked list application which allows users to create nodes and insert values into the nodes
from various different positions in the list. As well as looking over a specific node to see its contents. Application also allows
for deletion of nodes. This linked list a foundation needed for queus and stacks.

Lab 4 Description: 
- Code for using stacks and queues for data structures
